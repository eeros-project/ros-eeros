# ros-eeros
Wrapper library for [EEROS Robotics Framework](https://github.com/eeros-project/eeros-framework) to interface with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). 
The ros-eeros wrapper library enables the usage of the ROS with the [EEROS Robotics Framework](https://github.com/eeros-project/eeros-framework).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started using EEROS together with ROS is described in [Installation and Setup](https://wiki.eeros.org/getting_started/install_and_setup_development_environment) and more specifically in [Use with ROS](https://wiki.eeros.org/getting_started/install_and_setup_development_environment/use_with_ros).

The EEROS [Hardware Abstraction Layer](http://wiki.eeros.org/eeros_architecture/hal/start) needs a [configuration file](http://wiki.eeros.org/eeros_architecture/hal/configuration_file) which describes the hardware. A hardware configuration file for ROS can be found at (https://github.com/eeros-project/eeros-framework/tree/master/examples/ros). It is called *HalConfigRos.json*.
